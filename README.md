## Problem Statment
Each and every thing is now available online, which has increased the need and importance of e-commerce. As the number of internet users have been increased which is more likely to rise in the coming years, it is very important to have an e-commerce website for the business owners.



## Project Description

Boundless number of people use search engines to find products that they want to purchase. So, it is very cumbersome to reach out to such a large audience with a physical store. Nevertheless, this can be easily accomplished with an online store. So, I am trying to solve the needs of people by providing a platform for buying their regular use products, it also helps to decrease COVID cases as people get products on their doorstep,so they dont go outside. Also there are lot of benefits we can provide to consumer, Consumers can easily compare shops across different brands. Shopping from home is more convenient for the consumer, and much more.
